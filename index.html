          <summary><strong>Is LIFT the same as the new Metro for DC bill passed in December, 2022?</strong></summary>
          <ul><li> No. The <a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B24-0429" target="_blank">Metro for DC</a> bill, which was passed in December 2022, included provisions such as free-fare for bus rides originating in DC. Implementation of fare-free buses is pending budget.</li></ul>

      <details>
          <summary><strong>Is LIFT the same program as WMATA’s Metro Lift?</strong></summary>
          <ul><li>No. The Low-Income Fare Trial is a pilot program that offered DC residents transit discounts from January 2023 – October 2023. DC residents applied to the pilot program in 2022. WMATA’s Metro Lift program is an ongoing program launched in June 2023, specifically for households that receive SNAP.</li></ul>
