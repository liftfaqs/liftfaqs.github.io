       <details>
           <summary><strong>What is the Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)?</strong></summary>
           <ul><li>The <a href="https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/fare-subsidy" target="_blank">Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)</a> is a pilot program offering discounts on Metro and bus. Through a lottery, eligible residents will have a chance to get half-price discounts or free unlimited trips until October 31, 2023. If you're eligible and you <a href= "https://forms.beta.dc.gov/s3/LIFT-closed" target="_blank">enter the lottery</a> , you&rsquo;ll get one of the following:</li></ul>

      <details>
            <summary><strong>Is LIFT the same as the new Metro for DC bill passed in December, 2022?</strong></summary>
             <ul><li> No. The Metro For DC bill, which was passed in December 2022, included provisions such as free-fare for bus rides originating in DC. Implementation of fare-free buses is pending budget.</li></ul>
      </details>
    <br>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Is LIFT the same program as WMATA’s Metro Lift?</strong></summary>
             <ul><li> No. The Low-Income Fare Trial is a pilot program that offered DC residents transit discounts from January 2023 – October 2023. DC residents applied to the pilot program in 2022. WMATA’s Metro Lift program is an ongoing program launched in June 2023, specifically for households that receive SNAP.</li></ul>

    <a id="id.survey"></a> <h3>Survey</h3>
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Can I take the survey on a computer or a phone?</strong></summary>
    <ul><li> Yes, you can take the survey on a computer or phone with internet access. The survey should work in all browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).</li></ul>
    </details>
     <br>

    <details>
     <summary><strong>I received a text message or email about the LIFT survey. What is this??</strong></summary>
    <ul><li> We are surveying LIFT participants to learn about their transit use, as well as their emotional and economic well-being. Your answers to this survey will help DC government learn how the cost of bus and Metro affects you, and will help shape the future of public transit in DC.</li></ul>
    </details>
     <br>

    <details>
     <summary><strong>Can I take the survey if I did not receive a discount on bus and Metro from LIFT?</strong></summary>
     <ul><li> Yes. You can take the survey as long as you are a LIFT participant. If you applied to LIFT and were notified in 2023 that you would receive a $25 Visa gift card, a half-price discount, or free unlimited trips, you can participate in the survey.</li></ul>
    </details>
    <br>

     <details>
     <summary><strong>I am not a LIFT participant. Can I still take the survey?</strong></summary>
     <ul><li> No. The survey is open only to LIFT participants. 
     </details>
    <br>

   <details>    
    <summary><strong>Can I take the survey more than once?</strong></summary>
    <ul><li> If you accidentally close out the survey without finishing, you can begin again. We ask that each participant press “submit” on their completed survey only once. Only one complete response per eligible participant will count and be eligible for a gift card.</li></ul>
   </details>
  <br>

    <details> 
    <summary><strong>Can you go back and forth between languages once you’re in the middle of the survey?</strong></summary>
    <ul><li> Yes, but the survey will take you to the first page, so you’ll need to press the “Next”/forward arrow to get to the page you just left.
    </details> 
    <br>

     <details>   
    <summary><strong>What will I get for completing the survey?</strong></summary>
    <ul><li> Eligible LIFT participants who complete the survey will receive a $30 digital Visa gift card. Additionally, if you provide the number for your valid non-LIFT SmarTrip card in the survey, you’ll be entered in a lottery for an additional $30 digital Visa gift card.</li></ul>
     </details>
    <br>
    
    <details>  
    <summary><strong>Why am I asked to provide a non-LIFT SmarTrip card? </strong></summary>
    <ul><li> We will use information from your SmarTrip cards to know how program participants use the metro and the bus. We already have the SmarTrip numbers for LIFT cards, and we want to make sure we have a full picture of LIFT participants’ transit use as a group. When we share findings about card use for participants as a group; we will not share any of your identifying information.</li></ul>
    </details>
    <br>

    <details> 
     <summary><strong>Where can I find my SmarTrip card number? </strong></summary>
    <ul><li></li>
       <ul>
        <li>  If you have the physical card: Your SmarTrip card number is located on the back of your card towards the bottom. The set of numbers should start with 0167. </li>
        <li>  If your SmarTrip card is on your Apple Wallet: Go to the Apple Wallet app on your phone. Tap on your SmarTrip card. Tap the “...” in the top right corner of your screen. Click on “Card Number”. Your card number should start with 0176. You can copy and paste that number into the survey. Blank spaces should automatically appear between each group of 4 numbers. </li>
        <li>  If your SmarTrip is on your Google Wallet: Go to the Google Wallet app on your phone. Tap on your SmarTrip card. Your card number will be displayed at the top of your screen and should begin with 0177. </li>
        <li>  If you use the SmarTrip App: Open SmarTrip app. Go to “Cards” section at the bottom of your screen. Tap on your SmarTrip card. Your card number will be displayed at the top of your screen. </li>
       </ul>
      For additional help or more information visit Find Your SmarTrip Card Number.
    </details> 
    <br>
      
  <details>    
    <summary><strong> Why does the survey ask if my household receives SNAP benefits?  </strong></summary>
    <ul><li> Transit discount programs and other discount programs across the country are sometimes offered exclusively to SNAP participants. Understanding how households receiving SNAP use LIFT can help us to make recommendations for better serving those households.</li></ul>
  </details>
   <br>
    
      <a id="id.giftcards"></a> <h3>$25 Gift Cards </h3>
    <details>
     <summary><strong>I got an email or text message about a $25 gift card from LIFT. Is the message real?  </strong></summary>
     <ul><li> We sent out gift cards to LIFT participants through email and text on 7/10/2023, 7/31/2023, and 8/10/2023. You can email lift@dc.gov or call 202-304-1975 if you need further confirmation. </li></ul>
    </details>
    <br>
      
    <details>  
     <summary><strong>I'm not familiar with digital gift cards. How do they work?   </strong></summary>
      <ul><li> Digital gift cards are electronic versions of traditional plastic gift cards. You can check your balance by calling the toll-free number or going to the website listed on the back of your gift card. Perfect Gift has more information on how to check the balance of a digital gift card and how to use a digital gift card.</li></ul>
    </details>
  <br>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Can I add the money from my digital gift card to my LIFT SmarTrip card?    </strong></summary>
    <ul><li> WMATA does not recommend using gift cards to add value to an online SmarTrip card, since WMATA cannot guarantee that they will work.</li></ul>
    </details>
    <br>

     <details>
     <summary><strong>Do I have to spend my digital gift card by a certain date?     </strong></summary>
    <ul><li> Yes. The digital gift cards will expire after 6/2025. </li></ul>
     </details>
    <br>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>What if my $25 Visa gift card is lost or stolen?   </strong></summary>
    <ul><li> The gift cards work like cash; that means that if somebody else has your gift card number, they can use it and there is no way to get it back. We recommend keeping the number of your gift card private. If you encounter a problem with a gift card (e.g., the gift card does not work or has less value than expected), please contact Perfect Gift directly. You can report such issues to lift@dc.gov for our records, but only our vendor can resolve issues with the gift cards, and LIFT will not issue replacement (new) gift cards. </li></ul>

    <a id="id.eligibility"></a> <h3>Eligibility</h3>

        <ul>
                <li>You live in the District of Columbia.</li>
                <li>You&rsquo;re between 18-64 years old.</li>
                <li>You are not currently employed by Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) or the DC Government.</li>
                <li>Your household gets help paying for your utilities from the Department of Energy &amp; Environment (DOEE) or has in the past year. This means you received assistance from one or more of the following programs anytime since October 2020: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/liheap-and-udp" target="_blank">Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</a> </li>

                </ul>
                <li>You&rsquo;re not personally receiving a senior, student, or disability discount on transit including the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities, the <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program" target="_blank">Kids Ride Free</a> or the <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs" target="_blank">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a> for students. It&rsquo;s okay if someone else in your household is receiving one of these discounts.</li>
          </ul></ul>
    </details>
    <br>
      <details>
            <summary><strong>Why is DC Government offering the discounts by lottery?</strong></summary>
            <ul><li>There are more eligible individuals than we have funding for in the pilot, and a lottery gives everyone a fair chance of getting a discount. We&rsquo;ll also be able to use this lottery to inform a study, called a <a class="c9" href="https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/randomized-evaluation" target="_blank">randomized evaluation</a>, that will help us see if LIFT &nbsp;actually impacts the way residents get around and their employment, income, family, health, and energy use. (Learn <a href="#id.dataprotection">how we&rsquo;ll use and protect participants&rsquo; data</a>.) The findings may help us make transit more affordable and encourage transit use in DC.</li></ul>
    </details>
      <br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>I'm a senior aged 65+. How do I get a transit discount?</strong></summary>
           <ul><li>If you&rsquo;re 65+ years old, you qualify for a <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">Senior SmarTrip Card</a>. With the Senior SmarTrip card, you'd get a half-price discount on Metro and bus. You'll need an official picture ID that shows your date of birth. Bring it to a <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/stores.cfm" target="blank">Metro sales location</a> or any Montogmery County Library to get your Senior SmarTrip card.</li></ul>

    <details>   
            <summary><strong>I have a disability. How do I get a transit discount? </strong></summary>
           <ul><li>If you have a disability, you may qualify for a <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">Reduced Fare SmarTrip Card</a>. This would give you a half-price discount on Metro and bus. <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">Learn more here</a>. </li></ul> 
    </details>
    <br>
    <details> 
            <summary><strong>I’m not sure if I’m a DC government employee. Am I eligible for LIFT?</strong></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're a DC government employee, you're not eligible for LIFT. DC government employees are individuals who perform functions of District government and receive compensation for the performance of such services, or a member of a District government board or commission, with or without compensation. </li>
        <li>This does not include individuals performing services for District government as independent contractors.</li>
      </ul>
      </details><br>
      <details>
            <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving utility assistance from DOEE to sign up for this program?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>We want to make it as easy as possible to sign-up. DOEE already verifies income for households receiving utility assistance, so you will not need to verify your income again. In this way, we&rsquo;ll decrease the paperwork you&rsquo;ll need to enter the lottery.</li>
      <li>Because LIFT is a temporary pilot, it has limited spots. The findings from LIFT can be used to shape future policies and programs that make transit more affordable for low-income residents, not just DOEE customers.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Can more than one person in my household enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
        <ul><li>Only one member per household can sign up for LIFT.</li></ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>I don&rsquo;t meet the eligibility requirements, but I still need help paying for transit. What should I do?</strong></summary>
            <ul><li>If you&rsquo;re not eligible for LIFT, you may be eligible for other transit discounts, such as the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">&nbsp;Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities, or the <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program" target="_blank">Kids Ride Free</a> and <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs" target="_blank">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a> for students.</li></ul>
